## RDF->JSON Interoperability Utilities

This small module features facilities for generic JSON export of RDF such that it can be used in conjunction with e.g. bash scripting.
The focus here lies on simple but powerful RDF -> JSON conversion for interoperabilty with non-rdf toolchains.
This is different from a losslessly converting RDF to JSON-LD.
