Potential design issue:
- The RdfPopulatorPropertyBase has the targetRdfType set, which is a duplication from the
  RdfClass's property descriptor. Also, the default implementations' behavior is quite
  generic, so it appears there is no need to directly bind to a specific RdfType.
  Maybe the populator should obtain the targetRdfType indirectly
  either from the populationContext, or from the bean's rdfClass (i.e. beanRdfClass.getPropertyDescriptor(propertyName).getRdfType()
