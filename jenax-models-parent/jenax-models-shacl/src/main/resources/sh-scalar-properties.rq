# This file contains two complementary queries for checking for non-multivalued properties:
# (1) The first one infers "sh:maxCount 1" by ignoring any xsd:string and xsd:langString triples
# (2) The second query infers "sh:uniqueLang true" for those triples ignored by the first one

# Note that each query typically results in a full scan of the data.
